## About

Padel Bookings is a web application that simulates a real booking platform for padel games.<br/><br/>
You can either log in with your user or create a new one by registering. (feel free to login with username "Guest" and password "Guest " if you don't want to register).
<br/>
<br/>
Once you are logged in you will be redirected to the home page where you will see all the current bookings, and if you are looking for some action you can either join an existing booking or create a new one and add your friends to the game.
<br/>
When creating a new booking you can set the club, date and time of the game, type of court (indoor or outdoor), and specify the players that will play with you. Don't worry if you haven't found 3 other players yet, you can choose to leave the booking 'open' and any available player will join your booking shortly! If you prefer you can keep it closed and add other players later editing the booking.
<br/>
If you want to see the details and the players of a booking, you can click on it and you will see a detail page, where you can also join the booking if it's not yours and edit or delete it if you are the booking owner.
<br/>
Once you are done you can keep logged or if you prefer it you can logout.
<br/>
Happy boooking and have a good game!
